    <h1>Welcome to About Us!</h1>
    <h3>Who are we?</h3>
    <p>Our site is about origami designs. We use free internet sites that use step-by-step examples to create different origamis. 
    We created this site so people don't have to go searching for them. Most sites would tell you to register or pay but we do everything for free!
    </p>
    <h3>How to use our site?</h3>
    <p>Just click on the origami image you want to create and it will bring you through a step-by-step example to create your origami! Take some paper and start making your origami for free!</p>
    <h4>Don't forget to read the facts about your chosen origami animal and learn something new!</h4>
